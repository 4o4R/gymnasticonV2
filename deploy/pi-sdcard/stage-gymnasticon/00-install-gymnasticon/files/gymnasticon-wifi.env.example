# Copy this file to /boot/gymnasticon-wifi.env and replace the example values.

# WIFI_COUNTRY tells Raspberry Pi OS which regulatory domain to use. This
# unblocks the Wi-Fi radio without running raspi-config manually. Replace US
# with your local two-letter ISO country code (CA, GB, AU, etc.).
WIFI_COUNTRY=US

# WIFI_SSID is the exact name of your Wi-Fi network. Match the capitalization
# and punctuation exactly (Wi-Fi is case-sensitive).
WIFI_SSID=YourNetworkName

# WIFI_PSK is your Wi-Fi password. The helper escapes special characters for
# you, so paste it exactly as shown in your router’s settings.
